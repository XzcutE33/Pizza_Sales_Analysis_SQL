# Pizza_Sales_Analysis_SQL

In this project, I have followed a systematic approach to analyze the pizza sales data and derive meaningful insights.
The pizza sales data used in this analysis is collected from Kaggle. The link to the dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales

This pizza sales dataset has various features.

pizza_id: The unique identifier for each pizza in the dataset.
order_id: The unique identifier for each pizza order.
pizza_name_id: The identifier for each specific pizza name.
quantity: The number of pizzas ordered in each transaction.
order_date: The date when the pizza order was placed.
order_time: The time at which the pizza order was placed.
unit_price: The price of a single unit of pizza.
total_price: The total price of the pizza order, calculated as the unit price multiplied by the quantity.
pizza_size: The size or dimensions of the pizza. (S,M,L,XL,XXL)
pizza_category: The category or classification of the pizza, indicating its type or style. (Classic, Veggie, Supreme, Chicken)
pizza_ingredients: The list of ingredients used in the pizza preparation.
pizza_name: The name or label assigned to each specific pizza.

I have used SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset. This involved querying the database to obtain insights into customer preferences, revenue generation, and order patterns.
 
# Insights

1) Most common pizza size ordered is Large Size: The most preferred pizza size by customers is large. This indicates a tendency for customers to order pizzas in groups, potentially for sharing among family, friends, or colleagues.
2) Most ordered category is Classic Category: The Classic category emerges as the most ordered, highest revenue-generating, and most available pizza category. This popularity could be due to the timeless appeal and widespread recognition of classic pizza flavors, making them a go-to choice for customers.
3) Most pizza ordered time of the day: The most bustling period for the pizza shop is between 12 PM and 2 PM, indicating a significant attraction of customers during lunch hours. This can be attributed to people taking their lunch breaks from work or school and seeking a quick and convenient meal option.
4) Chicken Toppings Preference: The Thai Chicken Pizza, Barbeque Chicken Pizza & California Chicken Pizza, featuring the popular chicken topping, have emerged as top sellers.
5) These are just some insights which I have extracted but there are plenty of more insights uncovered through the code above but I have listed just some of the insights here. Do check out the others I have already wrote comments explaining every code block !! Hope you like my efforts !!
